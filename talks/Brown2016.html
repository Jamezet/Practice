<h3>
	Lecture on Gaussian processes - Brown University, 2016
</h3>

<i>!! This website will be updated soon! Below is a preliminary version!!</i>
<br><br>
During the tutorial I will run a few examples of Gaussian processes using the <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a> (a Python UI which runs and displays results within a browser).
<br><br>
The (current version) of the notebook can be viewed <a href=".Brown2016.ipynb">here</a>. If you want to download and run it locally, you can obtain the notebook here, but you will first have to install Python. For the last few steps of the tutorial we'll also use the GP package GPy, which can be installed following the instructions <a href="https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy">here</a>. 
<br><br>
The code snippets of the notebook can be copied and pasted directly in the python terminal, but you can actually run them within the Jupyter Notebook from your browser (check <a href="http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html">here</a> about how to it, but basically you just need to open Jupyter and load the ipynb file).

<br><br>
<i>!! The notebook file will be updated soon, but you can start looking at the preliminary version already online!!</i>
