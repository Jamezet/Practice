<h1>Deep Gaussian Processes (deep GPs)</h1>

<p>This page demonstrates the capabilities of deep GPs and describes examples of how to use these models with the provided MATLAB release.

</p><p>The deepGP software can be downloaded
<a href="https://github.com/SheffieldML/deepGP">here</a>.

</p><h2>Release Information</h2>
<p><b>Current release is 1.0</b>.
</p><p>This is the release that fixed some bugs and added improvements to the initial release 0.1.
</p><p>As well as downloading the deepGP software you need to obtain some dependencies, as described in the <a href="https://github.com/SheffieldML/deepGP">download page</a> of deep GPs.


</p><h4>Version 0.1</h4>
<p>This initial release is for the AISTATS 2013 submission.

</p><h2>What is a deep GP?</h2>
<p><i>Below, read a small intro or jump to the <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/SheffieldML/deepGP/blob/master/deepGP/html/index.html#examples">examples</a></i>.

</p><p>A deep Gaussian process (deep GP) is a Deep Belief Network (DBN) formulated as a generative model where an initial input multivariate variable
 <b><img src="./Deep Gaussian Processes - Model demonstration and MATLAB Software_files/X_H.png" width="25"></b> is mapped to an observed output multivariate variable <b><img src="./Deep Gaussian Processes - Model demonstration and MATLAB Software_files/X_0.png" width="20"></b> through a cascade of hidden layers <b><img src="./Deep Gaussian Processes - Model demonstration and MATLAB Software_files/Xs.png" width="120"></b> &nbsp; as can be seen in the figure below:
 <br>
</p><p></p><center><img src="./Deep Gaussian Processes - Model demonstration and MATLAB Software_files/hierarchy2.png" width="450"><br></center>
<br><br><br><br>
 In contrast to traditional DBNs, here the transformation between layers is probabilistic and modelled with GPs. This leads to a powerful model (which, overall, is not a GP) which can learn from complex data in a non-parametric fashion. 

<p><b>Supervised</b> and <b>unsupervised</b> learning are both supported. In the later case, the difference is that the layer on the top is hidden and learned from the data, similarly to all other hidden layers.

</p><h3>Sampling</h3>
Sampling from deep GP models is trivial; since it is a generative model, one just needs to start sampling from the top layer and use each sample as input for the layer below. For example, see the figure below:
<br>
<p></p><center><img src="./Deep Gaussian Processes - Model demonstration and MATLAB Software_files/gpSample.png" width="400"><br></center>
<br><br><br><br>
On the very top layer, we have normal GP samples from an RBF covariance function which uses an equally spaced vector as input. These samples are, in turn, fed to the next layer as input and the output is fed to the last layer. The samples in the last layers show the kinds of functions that deep GPs can model. Obviously, deep GPs are more generic than GPs and can model more "difficult" functions, for example ones involving long range correlations between datapoints and a varying degree of smoothness, as the examples above.

<p>For groovy visualisations of deep GP samples you can also check <a href="http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/duvenaud/">David Duvenaud's</a> videos

</p><h3>Training</h3>
As shown above, sampling from deep GPs is trivial. The real challenge is to be able to efficiently train these models while also effectively <strong>regularizing</strong> them to avoid overfitting. Our deepGP framework is doing exactly this, by following a Bayesian paradigm. All latent spaces are integrated out (i.e. we learn a posterior distribution over them) and a variational framework allows for the approximation of the model <strong>evidence</strong>.  This means that we can:
<ul>
<li>Have a <strong>posterior</strong> of the latent positions given the observations</li>
<li>Approximate the evidence which means we can do <strong>Bayesian model selection</strong> automatically (penalize complex models)</li>
<li>Find the <strong>structure of the deep network automatically</strong>, since the Bayesian framework "switches off" unnecessary nodes, connections or layers.
</li></ul>

<p>The training framework allows to <strong>group nodes</strong> in an <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/SheffieldML/deepGP/blob/master/deepGP/html/index.html#MRD">MRD</a> fashion (<i>Damianou
et al. [2012]</i>) which is designed to model loosely correlated
data sets within the same model.
If we have &nbsp; <img src="./Deep Gaussian Processes - Model demonstration and MATLAB Software_files/M_h.png" width="25">&nbsp; groups in layer <i>h</i>, then our framework allows to directly plug in this initial architecture and define and objective function which is split in terms as shown on the left of the picture below:
</p><p></p><center><img src="./Deep Gaussian Processes - Model demonstration and MATLAB Software_files/hierarchyFull_compact2.png" width="450"><br></center>
<br><br>
As can be seen, adding or removing layers/groups/nodes from this initial structure just adds factors in the final objective function.

Examples showed here can be recreated by running the <code>tutorial.m</code> script of the package.

<h3>Toy data - unsupervised learning</h3>
<p>The deep GPs are first tested on toy data, created by sampling
from a three-level stack of GPs. The true hierarchy is depicted
in the demo, once the deep GP is trained. In short, from the top latent
layer (X2) two intermediate latent signals are generated (XA and XB). 
These, in turn, together generate 10-dimensional observations
(YA, YB) through sampling of another GP. These observations are then
used to train the following models: a deep GP, a simple stacked PCA
and a stacked Isomap method. From these models, only the deep GP
marginalises the latent spaces and, in contrast to the other two,
it is not given any information about the dimensionality of each true
signal in the hierarchy; instead, this is learnt automatically
through ARD. The reconstructions are shown below.

    <i>Reconstruction of the toy data. From left to right: original hierarhcy and reconstruction by deepGP, stacked Isomap and stacked PCA.</i>
</center>


<p>The deep GP finds the correct dimensionality for each
hidden layer, but it also discovers latent signals which are closer
to the real ones.

</p><p>The model can be parametrized in many ways, and the demo here considers
a basic parameterization. You can experiment with different latent space
initialisations, different kernels (linear, non-linear, etc).
For other possible options check <code>hsvargplvm_init.m</code> and the various demos.

</p><h3>Toy data - supervised learning (regression / warped GP)</h3>
<p>This is a simple regression demo which uses a toy dataset of
input-output pairs [<b>t</b>, <b>Y</b>] generated as follows: given an initial equally
spaced input <b>t</b>, we feed this to a GP from which we sample outputs
<b>X</b> which constitute an intermediate latent space. These are in turn fed to another GP from which we sample outputs
<b>Y</b>. This an implementation of a <i>warped GP</i> and can also be run for multivariate inputs/outputs. Deep GPs (that use sparse GP apprpoximations by default) are compared
to full (non-sparse) GPs (aka 'ftc') and to sparse GPs with the 'fitc'
approximation.

</p><p>The above experiment is run multiple times with random sets, and the
results are plotted for every trial, obtaining the plot below:
</p><p></p><center><img src="./Deep Gaussian Processes - Model demonstration and MATLAB Software_files/toyRegResults.png" width="300"><br></center>

<p>Modeling-wise, this demo differs from the unsupervised learning one in that
the deep GP has observed inputs on the top layer. Then, the kernel used for
the mapping between the top layer and the one below, couples all inputs.

initialisations, different kernels (linear, non-linear, etc).

</p><h3>Motion capture and multiview data</h3>
Here we recreate a motion
capture data experiment from Lawrence and Moore
[2007]. They used data from the CMU MOCAP database
representing two subjects walking towards each other and
performing a "high-five". 
To account for the correlated motions of the subjects we
applied deepGPs with a two-level hierarchy where the
two observation sets were taken to be conditionally independent given their parent latent layer. In the layer closest
to the data we associated each GP-LVM with a different set
of ARD parameters, allowing the layer above to be used
in different ways for each character. DeepGP discovered a common subspace in the intermediate layer. This
is expected, as the two subjects perform very similar motions with opposite directions. The optimised ARD kernel weights are also
a means of automatically selecting the dimensionality of
each layer and subspace. This kind of modelling is impossible for a MAP method like [Lawrence and Moore, 2007]
which requires the exact latent structure to be given a priori.
The full latent space learned by the aforementioned MAP
method is plotted in the figure below:

<p></p><center><img src="./Deep Gaussian Processes - Model demonstration and MATLAB Software_files/highFiveExperiment.png" width="650"><br></center>
<br><br>

Further, we can sample from these spaces to see what kind
of information they encode. Indeed, we observed that the
top layer generates outputs which correspond to different
variations of the whole sequence, while when sampling
from the first layer we obtain outputs which only differ in
a small subset of the output dimensions, e.g. those corresponding to the subjects hand.






<h3>Digits data and feature learning</h3>
This experiment demonstrates the ability of our model
to learn latent features of increasing abstraction and we
demonstrate the usefulness of an analytic bound on the
model evidence as a means of evaluating the quality of the
model fit for different choices of the overall depth of the
hierarchy. We subsampled a small data set consisting of
examples for each of the digits {0, 1, 6} taken from the
USPS handwritten digit database. 

<h4><i>Model selection and reconstruction</i></h4>
We experimented with deep
GPs of depth ranging from 1 (equivalent to Bayesian
GP-LVM) to 9 hidden layers and evaluated each model
by measuring the nearest neighbour error in the latent features discovered in each hierarchy. We found that the Bayesian training framework was trying to switch off models with more than 5 hidden layers. Also, the best performance (in terms of NN error) was achieved with the model which had the highest marginal likelihood, the one with 5 layers. The 2D projection of the discovered space of this model is shown below and illustrates an excellent separation between classes:

<p></p><center><img src="./Deep Gaussian Processes - Model demonstration and MATLAB Software_files/H5_latentSpaceDigits.png" width="650"><br></center>

<h4><i>Feature discovery and sampling</i></h4>
For the 5-layer model, we also sampled from each level of the hierarchy and generated new data by interpolating from the training ones. We did that by varying one latent dimension of one layer at a time, to discover what each dimension encodes. The ARD kernel weights (one for each dimension and layer) show us which dimensions are relevant (and how "linear" they are).

<p> In the figure below one can see the optimised weights per layer and some samples from some dimension of each layer.

</p><p></p><center><img src="./Deep Gaussian Processes - Model demonstration and MATLAB Software_files/digitsExperiment.png" width="950"><br></center>

<p> The figure demonstrates that, as we rise in the hierarchy, features of increasing abstraction are accounted for: the lower levels encode local features
whereas the higher ones encode more abstract information. 

</p><p>We discovered many more features, but here we show only some for each layer. The file <code>demDigitsDemonstration.m</code> lets you interactively sample from any layer/dimension. A short demonstration of how this is done, is shown in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8-vxt8wxBU">video below</a>:
